  CompuTester is a versatile web application that enables users to quickly test and diagnose issues with their personal devices. With its multilingual interface, users can determine if peripherals such as webcams and speakers are working properly, as well as obtain useful information about their network, IP address, user agent, and browser version. This data can be especially valuable in diagnosing connectivity issues or identifying browser incompatibilities. Whether you're a repair technician, a power user, or simply looking to troubleshoot an issue with your device, CompuTester can provide valuable insights and help you get back up and running quickly.

### Landing Page
The four core CompuTester tests can be seen below on the "peripherals" page. Webcam, microphone, speaker and keyboard tests are provided to help with fast diagnostic of laptops.

## Mobile support
The WebApp is compatible with devices of all sizes and all OS's, and consistent improvements are being made. Due to the limitations of not having a physical keyboard, the keyboard test is not available on touchscreen devices at this time.
