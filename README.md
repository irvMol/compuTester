## Introduction

CompuTester is a versatile web application designed to help users quickly test and diagnose issues with their personal devices. This multilingual tool provides essential functionality to check the status of peripherals such as webcams, microphones, speakers, and keyboards. Additionally, it offers valuable information about network details, IP addresses, user agents, and browser versions. Whether you are a repair technician, a power user, or simply trying to troubleshoot device issues, CompuTester can provide valuable insights and help you get back up and running quickly.

## Accessing the WebApp

You can access CompuTester by visiting the official website: [https://computester.com](https://computester.com).

## Features

### Landing Page

The CompuTester landing page offers four core tests for diagnosing laptop issues:

- **Webcam Test**: Quickly determine the status of your webcam.
- **Microphone Test**: Check if your microphone is functioning correctly.
- **Speaker Test**: Ensure your speakers are working as expected.
- **Keyboard Test**: Validate the functionality of your keyboard.

These tests are particularly useful for fast diagnostics of laptops and were initially designed for repairing and refurbishing Chromebooks.

## Mobile Support

CompuTester is compatible with devices of all sizes and operating systems. The development team is continuously working to improve mobile support. Due to the limitations of not having a physical keyboard, the keyboard test is not available on touchscreen devices at this time.
