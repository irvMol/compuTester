### Landing Page
The four core CompuTester tests can be seen below on the "peripherals" page. Webcam, microphone, speaker and keyboard tests are provided to help with fast diagnostic of laptops. This tool was originally designed for repairing and refurbishing chromebooks at a fast rate, where these hardware tests are vital.

## Mobile support
The WebApp is compatible with devices of all sizes and all OS's, and consistent improvements are being made. Due to the limitations of not having a physical keyboard, the keyboard test is not available on touchscreen devices at this time.
